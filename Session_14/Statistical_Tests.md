### At First we should ask our self 3 questions

1- What level of measurment was used for the data we are analyzing

2- How many samples do we have ?

3- What is the purpose of our analysis

## T-Tests:

$Independent Samples T-Test$:

- Used to compare means between two independent groups
  (e.g., comparing the test scores of two different groups of students).

  $ Paired Samples T-Test $ :

- Used to compare means of paired or matched data
  (e.g., before and after measurements on the same subjects).

## Chi-Square Test:

- Used to test the association or independence between two categorical variables in a contingency table.

## Regression Analysis:

- $ Linear Regression $: Used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.

- $ Logistic Regression $: Used when the dependent variable is binary (e.g., yes/no, success/failure) and you want to model the probability of an event occurring.

- $ Multiple Regression $: Used when there are multiple independent variables that may affect a dependent variable.

## What is the P-Value ? :

- The p-value, short for "probability value," is a fundamental concept in statistical hypothesis testing. it helps you determine whether the observed data provides enough support to reject a specific hypothesis or not.
