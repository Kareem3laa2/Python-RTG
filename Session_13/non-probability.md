## Convinence Sampling

- Involves selecting individuals or items that are most readily available or convenient to the researcher.

- It's often used for quick and easy data collection
  but can lead to sampling bias because it may not represent the entire population.

## Snowball Sampling

- Commonly used in studies involving hard-to-reach populations or when there is no clear sampling frame.

- The researcher starts with a small number of participants and asks them to refer or "snowball" other potential participants.

- This method is often used in social network studies or studies of hidden populations.

## Quota Sampling

- The population is divided into subgroups, and a non-random sample is taken from each subgroup .
- This method ensures that specific subgroups are adequately represented in the sample but does not guarantee representativeness for the
  entire population.

## Judgemental Sampling

- In this method, the researcher selects specific individuals or items intentionally based on their judgment or knowledge of the  
  population.
- It's used when the researcher believes that certain groups or elements are more important or relevant to the study.
