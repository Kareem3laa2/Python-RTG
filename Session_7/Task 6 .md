## Round Robin :

- Round Robin is a preemptive scheduling algorithm where each process is assigned a fixed time slice (quantum) to execute. When a time slice expires, the process is moved to the back of the queue, and the CPU is allocated to the next process in line\

## FCFS :

- FCFS is a non-preemptive scheduling algorithm where processes are executed in the order they arrive in the queue.
  and the proccess doesn't leave the queue until it's done

## priorty :

- assigns priority levels to each process. The process with the highest priority gets to execute first. Preemptive and non-preemptive versions are possible.
