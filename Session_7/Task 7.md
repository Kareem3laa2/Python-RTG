## Parallel Processing :

- Parallel processing refers to the simultaneous execution of multiple tasks or processes to achieve a common goal.
  It involves dividing a problem into smaller subproblems and executing them concurrently on multiple processing units
  (e.g., CPU cores, GPUs).

  ## Threads :

  - Threads are lightweight units of execution within a single process. Multiple threads within a process share the same memory space and resources.
