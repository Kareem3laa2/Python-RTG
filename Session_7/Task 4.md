## Linux :

- Linux is a Unix-like operating system kernel that was created by Linus Torvalds in 1991. It was inspired by Unix but built from scratch.

- Linux is open-source and distributed under the GNU General Public License (GPL). This means that the source code is freely available, and anyone can modify and distribute it. Examples of Linux distributions include Ubuntu, CentOS, and Fedora.
