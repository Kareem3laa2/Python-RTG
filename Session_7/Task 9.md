#### What is Clean code principles (SOLID) ?

- ## S - Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):

  - A class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have a single responsibility.
  - Avoid creating classes that try to do too much; split them into smaller, more focused

- ## O - Open/Closed Principle (OCP):

  - Software entities (such as classes, modules, and functions) should be open for extension but closed for modification.
  - New functionality should be added through extensions rather than altering existing code.

- ## L - Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):

  - Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types without affecting the correctness of the program.
  - Derived classes should be able to be used interchangeably with their base classes.

- ## I - Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):

  - Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they don't use.
  - Avoid creating large, monolithic interfaces; design smaller, more specific interfaces.

- ## D - Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):

  - High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
  - Abstractions should not depend on details; details should depend on abstractions.
