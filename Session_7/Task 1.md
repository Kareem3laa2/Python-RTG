## Von Neumann Architecture:

- the most common type of computer architecture it consists of the following key components:
  **Central Processing Unit (CPU)**: Executes instructions and performs calculations.
  **Memory Unit**: Stores both instructions and data in a single memory space.
  **Control Unit**: Manages the flow of instructions and data between memory, the CPU, and other hardware components.
  **Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)**: Performs arithmetic and logical operations on data. -**Input/Output (I/O) System**: Facilitates communication between the computer and external devices.

## Harvard Architecture:

- separates the memory space for instructions and data, leading to two distinct memory systems
  **Instruction Memory:** Stores program instructions.
  **Data Memory:** Stores data used by the program.
  **Control Unit:** Manages instruction and data flows between memory and the CPU.
  **Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU):** Performs calculations and logical operations.

#### Because Harvard architecture keeps instructions and data separate, the CPU can fetch both an instruction and data simultaneously, potentially improving performance in cases where frequent memory access is required. This architecture is commonly used in microcontrollers and embedded systems where efficiency is critical.
